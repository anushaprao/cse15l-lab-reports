# CSE 15L Lab Report 4
## CSE Labs "Done Quick"
In this lab, we attempted to complete routine tasks using shortcuts in order to maximize efficiency. 

The steps for the tasks were numbered and give to us. The first step is to delete any existing forks of the lab7 repository. This can be done by going into the fork's settings, scrolling down and selecting "Delete this repository." The second step is to fork the repository. The third step before we get into the lab is to start the timer!

### Step 4: Log into ieng6
*Keys pressed: ```<up><enter>```*

The *```ssh cs15lwi23adu@ieng6.ucsd.edu```* command was 1 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it. Thanks to our pre-lab set-up of setting up ssh keys in GitHub, I no longer have to type my password in as I am authenicated using a private key file on my local machine.

### Step 5: Clone Your Fork of the Lab7 Repository

To clone the repository, I copied the SSH key found in my GitHub fork:

Then, I typed out the command ```git clone git@github.com:anushaprao/lab7.git``` and pressed ```<enter>```.

### Step 6: Running the Tests to Demonstrate Errors in the Code
The first thing I must make sure I do is change into the lab7 directory.
