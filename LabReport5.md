# CSE 15L Lab Report 5
## Looking Further at Lab Report 3: Researching Commands

One of my favorite lab reports we did was Lab Report 3, where I looked at 3 command line options for the *grep* command. I really enjoyed this lab because it showed me what I could practically use this command for, and it challenged me to implement it in my own terminal.
For Lab Report 5, I would like to take inspiration from the prompt and do a similar exploration for the *find* command. 

**Example 1:**
Running the code: 
``` 
find -name
