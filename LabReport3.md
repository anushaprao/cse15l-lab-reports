# CSE 15L Lab Report 3
## Researching Commands
The command I selected for this lab report was *grep*. 

The first command line option that I utilized was -c. This option returns the number of lines that match the string/pattern that is being searched for. 

**INSERT CODE BLOCK(2)**

The second command line option that I looked at was -n. This option returns the line number and the line that the string/substring being searched for is found on within a given file.

**INSERT CODE BLOCK(2)**

The third command line option that I experimented with was -i. This option returns all lines that contain the string being searched for with no delineation based on case. Meaning it searches for both upper- and lower-case variations of the string being searched for.

**INSERT CODE BLOCK(2)** (https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/grep-command-in-unix/)

The fourth command line option that I explored was -r. This option recursively searches the files under a directory for the string being searched for.
